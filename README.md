#Algorithms-Visualizer

Welcome to the Algorithm Visualizer! In this interactive tool, we will explore and visualize seven different algorithms to deepen our understanding of their inner workings.

Quicksort Algorithm:
The Quicksort Algorithm is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and simplicity. By recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting them around a chosen pivot element, Quicksort achieves an average time complexity of O(n log n). Through our visualizer, you'll witness how this algorithm efficiently rearranges elements to sort an array.

Food Fill Algorithm:
The Food Fill Algorithm, also known as the Flood Fill Algorithm, is widely used in computer graphics and image processing. It is utilized to fill a bounded area in an image with a specific color. Our visualizer will demonstrate how this algorithm explores neighboring pixels and fills connected regions in an image.

Union Find Algorithm:
The Union Find Algorithm, also called the Disjoint Set Union, is used to solve various problems involving dynamic connectivity. It efficiently maintains a collection of disjoint sets, providing operations such as union and find. In our visualizer, you'll witness how this algorithm establishes connections between elements and detects cycles in a graph.

Selection Sort Algorithm:
Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from an unsorted part of the array and places it at the beginning. Although not as efficient as other sorting algorithms, its simplicity makes it easy to understand. Through our visualizer, you'll observe how Selection Sort iteratively finds the smallest element and swaps it into the correct position.

Counting Sort Algorithm:
Counting Sort is a linear time complexity algorithm used for sorting integers with a limited range. It works by counting the occurrences of each element and placing them in the correct order. Our visualizer will showcase how this algorithm determines the correct position of each element based on its count.

Heap Sort Algorithm:
Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that leverages the properties of a heap data structure. By building a max-heap and repeatedly extracting the maximum element, Heap Sort achieves an average time complexity of O(n log n). In our visualizer, you'll witness the step-by-step process of constructing a heap and sorting the elements.

Topological Sort Algorithm:
Topological Sort is used to order the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in such a way that every directed edge goes from a vertex earlier in the order to a vertex later in the order. It is widely used in dependency resolution and task scheduling. Our visualizer will demonstrate how this algorithm identifies a linear ordering of the vertices based on their dependencies.

Through our Algorithm Visualizer, you will have the opportunity to interactively explore and understand these algorithms, helping you gain a deeper insight into their inner workings and practical applications. Let's dive in and unravel the magic of algorithms!
